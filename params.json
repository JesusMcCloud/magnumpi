However, an insecure password safe (or worse: well disguised spyware) poses a threat. The Google Play Store offers lots of different password safes all of which are praised by their developers as *the best, most secure* one of all.\r\nMagnum PI makes it possible to check if applications live up to the promise a high level of security.\r\n\r\nMagnum PI relies on the [XPosed](http://xposed.info/ \"XPosed\") framework to instrument application code at runtime. A client running on a PC called *Eve's Dropper*  (pun intended) processes the gathered information which includes:\r\n\r\n* The application's APK\r\n* All classes loaded during an applications life cycle\r\n* Every method invocation including\r\n    * Method parameters\r\n    * Return value\r\n    * Calling method\r\n\r\nThis information is used on the client to visualise the class hierarchy, compute graphical, interactive execution traces and even display the source code of the application (decompiled from the APK). All gathered information can be filtered and exported at any time.\r\n\r\nFor more information and a user manual check out [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/JesusMcCloud/magnumpi).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
